Website

Most aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. However, the website (specifically the resume) is not responsive. It works well in large browsing windows. I also have only tested the design in Chrome and Safari.  

I spoke with Cecily Lo about the assignment a little but we didn't work on it together.

I spent approximately 15 hours completing the assignment.
