                        <p>Hey! My name is Sam and I'm from Mill Valley, California. Mill Valley is a small town just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. I'm currently a junior at Tufts University where I study Computer Science and Engineering Psychology. Engineering Psychology is basically the same as Human Factors Engineering and is all about designing things that are easy for human beings to use. As much as I love coding and designing the next big idea, I also love delicious food, sailing, roadtrips, and adventuring outdoors. One thing I don't like is goat cheese.</p>
