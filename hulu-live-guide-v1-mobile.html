        <h1>Hulu Live Guide V1</h1>
        <callout>A bridge between traditional cable and the future of television.</callout>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Context</h3>
        <p2>When Hulu launched their live TV experience, they aimed to transform traditional linear programming into an on-demand experience. Live content was mixed in with regular on-demand content and suggested to users with the usual recommendation algorithms. However, this solution failed to meet expectations.<br><br>Users wanted a dedicated place where they could get to live TV quickly and engage in traditional behaviors such as channel-flipping or planning a night of TV watching. One user phrased it simply, “You can’t call this live TV. You have to choose what you want to watch, which defeats the purpose of live TV."</p2>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p2>Make it easy for users to see what’s currently live on TV.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Allow users to engage in traditional channel-flipping behavior.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Increase the amount of live TV minutes watched.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Make it easier for users to record content.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Design an experience that feels native on mobile devices.</p2></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Process</h3>
        <p2>Over the next ten months, my team and I began a comprehensive overhaul of live TV on Hulu. We mapped user journeys across our existing experiences, identifying problems and opportunities along the way. We analyzed traditional cable TV experiences as well as new mobile video experiences.<br><br>I created hundreds of sketches, wireframes, and prototypes, gathering feedback from users and stakeholders every step of the way. After unifying behind a common solution, we broke it down into multiple versions, to be progressively released and validated.</p2>

    <div class="text">
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Solution</h3>
        <p2>The solution includes a dedicated spot for live TV in the global tab bar. Upon tapping it, playback of a user’s most recently watched channel begins, just like turning on the TV. No decision making necessary. Playback occurs in the new portrait player, a familiar feature on many mobile video services. In portrait playback, users can scroll through the channels below to see what else is on. Users can filter the channels by type, swipe on channel rows to see what’s up next, or tap the three dots to set something to record.<br><br>As Techcrunch described, “The guide… is a much easier way of seeing what’s on now… Hulu now works in portrait mode, so you can browse programming while streaming.”</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p2><b><b>Communicate often.</b></b> This was an extensive project that touched all areas of the app and involved many different departments. By providing weekly updates and team syncs, teams were able to anticipate changes and respond proactively.  <br><br><b><b>Solve the biggest needs first.</b></b> User research revealed countless opportunities for the live TV experience. Rather than addressing everything, it was important to identify the most impactful and technically feasible needs first. I decided to prioritize getting to live TV quickly, browsing and flipping between channels, and supporting chromecast for mobile users. As much as I love a comprehensive solution, I learned how important it is to create a path for getting there that also allows for adjustment along the way.<br><br><b><b>Make research specific.</b></b> Some of our research studies took significant time and preparation. These large studies also led to indecisive outcomes because of too many variables and unclear hypotheses. Instead of large studies, it was more helpful to prototype a specific problem and run a quick hallway test. Just five participants could help indicate one direction over another.</p2>
