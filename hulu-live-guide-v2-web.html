        <h1>Hulu Live Guide V2</h1>
        <callout>A better live TV guide for the Hulu website.</callout>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Context</h3>
        <p2>The initial experience for live TV on the Hulu website allowed users to jump into live playback using the top navigation bar. Once in playback, users could view a basic live TV guide that showed what was currently playing across channels. In the guide, users could engage in channel flipping or click forward to see upcoming items on that channel. <br><br>However, research showed that users still wanted to see upcoming content across all channels at the same time to more easily plan a night of TV watching. Users also wanted a way to record content and a better way to filter channels based on content type, such as sports, movies, or kids content.</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p2>Let users plan ahead by seeing upcoming content across channels in the guide.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Provide users with a way to dive deeper into content in the guide without leaving playback.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Make it easier for users to record current and upcoming content in the guide.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Give users a way to filter current and upcoming content by type.</p2></li>
            <li><p2>Design a solution that works seamlessly with the rest of the Hulu web experience.</p2></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Process</h3>
        <p2>To begin, I performed a competitive analysis of other web competitors, noting what worked and what didn’t in relation to our existing guide. Next, I created some initial sketches, wireframes, and user flows. From here, I was able to break down the project into four solvable areas: guide location, actions and additional information, navigation through time, and content-specific filtering. By breaking down the project into these solvable pieces, I was able to conduct more specific testing, build simpler prototypes, and design clearer options when making project decisions.<br><br>Throughout the design process, I checked in weekly with the engineering teams, product management, and the web platform design team. I even involved them in testing and sketching sessions to align on goals, challenges, and design decisions.</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Solution</h3>
        <p2>Based on testing, I decided to move the guide to a level below the player. Doing so allows users to see a fuller guide with more upcoming content while playback can continue unobstructed in the mini-player. Users can click on an item in the guide to learn more, see show artwork, and take actions such as record or find more episodes. They can do this without ever leaving playback. Upon entering live TV, users see an autoplaying video masthead of their most recent channel. This allows users to sit back and start watching or easily scroll down to find something else. Overall, the new web live guide adds a serious amount of functionality and control while still integrating seamlessly with the rest of the web experience.</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p2><b><b>Break things down.</b></b> If the design problem is too large, it can be easy to enter a spin cycle of conflicting feedback and solutions. By breaking this project down into solvable pieces, I was able to address problems more effectively and make decisions more quickly. <br><br><b><b>Adjust the story for the stakeholder.</b></b> Product managers want to hear how the design addresses performance metrics. Developers care about platform nativity and logical flows. Rather than speaking to color choice and button styling, I learned that it was more useful to adjust my design narrative based on the concerns of my audience.<br><br><b><b>Work with the design system and brand.</b></b> Some solutions, like the initial live TV masthead, worked really well for the problem I was solving, but then broke down when applied to the rest of the website. Other times, like in the case of our type styles, I couldn’t make the existing system work for the problem I was solving. Ultimately, I learned that it’s a balance of the two: adapting the system to fit the solution and adapting the solution to work with the system.</p2>
