        <h1>Hulu Video Player Redesign</h1>
        <callout>A smoother playback experience for iOS and Android.</callout>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Context</h3>
        <p2>When I started at Hulu, we were receiving hundreds of complaints a day in app store reviews and research
            surveys about our video player on phones and tablets. In additional to general playback bugs, the player had
            a full-screen seeking feature that users found confusing and frustrating.</p2>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p2>Address major user pain points, especially around accidental seeking and full-screen seeking.</p2>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p2>Design a player that works better with live TV content.</p2>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p2>Ensure that experience feels native to both tablet and phone devices.</p2>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Process</h3>
        <p2>The first step in the project was to go through user reviews and identify common pain points in the current
            experience. After summarizing these paint points, I performed a competitive analysis, looking at other video
            services and how their video players worked with regard to short content, long content, advertisements, and
            live TV. The next step was to ideate on a number of different sketches and designs. Along with these
            ideations, I developed prototypes using FramerJS.<br><br>Eventually, I consolidated these prototypes into
            two versions: one without full-screen seeking and one with an adapted version that felt more predictable and
            required a long press to begin. The results indicated that the new full-screen seeking prototype performed
            better, albeit with a number of opportunities for further improvement. From here, I was able to begin
            refining the design and prepare it for development.</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Design Solution</h3>
        <p2>Upon releasing the new design, the number of user complaints about video playback dropped significantly. The
            redesigned mobile video player has a more intuitive full-screen seeking experience that prevents accidental
            seeks and allows users to seek through live and on-demand content with higher accuracy. It also allows users
            to double tap to jump forward in the video by a certain amount. This is a feature found in the YouTube
            player that also tested well during our study.</p2>

        <h3 class="top-margin bottom-margin">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p2><b><b>Earn the design.</b></b> Initially, I handled this project in a tactical manner, making minor
            adjustments to the existing experience to address known pain points. However, eventually I tried pursuing
            drastically different and crazy directions. While most of these didn’t make sense, it was a valuable process
            to go through. It showed me what was and wasn’t working and also helped me innovate on an uncommon
            feature.<br><br><b><b>Document designs from a development perspective.</b></b> Video players are hard to
            spec for developers because the interface constantly changes depending on user inputs. This project showed
            me how important it is to create thorough and iterative documentation in collaboration with the developer,
            if possible.<br><br><b><b>Nail the wireframes before starting the prototypes.</b></b> It’s easy to make
            changes to wireframes and storyboards, but difficult to change prototypes. Building prototypes can be time
            intensive, especially when they encompass a lot of functionality. For this project, it would have been
            faster to get my wireframes and storyboard flows right before spending time to build all the prototypes.
